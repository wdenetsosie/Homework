## Business Activities

* Uplift is a buy now pay later (BNPL) service for travel and entertainment.  It has partnered with over 300 travel companies, including airlines, cruise lines, and entertainment venue companies (e.g., SeatGeek).

* Through its partnerships with travel industry companies, members of Uplift can book and pay for travel at a travel company's primary booking website utilizing Uplift as a means of payment via short-term loans (up to 3 years).

* Uplift touts itself as "digital marketers and fintech experts whose core technology, the UpLift Engine, was designed by the team that created the original travel meta-search. Our flagship product, Pay Monthly, lets travelers buy now and pay later, with monthly installment payments offered at the industry's lowest rates.Uplift generates its revenues primarily from interest on loans to its members."

* Uplift utilizes travel metasearch technology, which allows a user to search across multiple travel websites for a particular destination.

## Landscape

* Uplift operates in the payments and lending fintech domains.  According to Brian Barth, Uplift's co-founder, "Uplift’s platform easily integrates into the most complicated legacy systems, with the highest levels of security, privacy and data management."  *Fintech Interview with the Chief Executive Officer, Uplift - Brian Barth*, FinTecBuzz (2021, September 1), https://fintecbuzz.com/fintech-interview-with-the-chief-executive-officer-uplift-brian-barth/.

* This has created market penetration as evidenced by its partnerships with hundreds of travel companies.  This permits incorporation of Uplift's technology directly into partner websites, mobile apps, and call centers.    Id.

* Uplift is industry targeted in the travel and entertainment industries.  The travel industry accounted for $101 billion in commerce in May 2022.  Source:  U.S. Travel Association, June 2022, *Monthly Travel Data Report*, https://www.ustravel.org/research/monthly-travel-data-report.  Competing payment and lending fintech companies like Affirm typically provide either a debit or payment card for purchases across many retail sectors.

* Uplift's technology allows users to search travel options and pay for and finance the trip.  This has resulted a higher conversion rate and the upgrading of travel.

* It appears that only Uplift has made significant penetration in the BNPL travel fintech market space.  However, this is difficult to determine based on the lack of available data released by Uplift.

* Primary competitors are traditional travel booking websites, which accept payments by credit or debit card only.

* According to a survey of 5,000 global travelers done any PhocusWire in 2022, 68% of travelers would be encouraged to spend more than usual on summer travel  utilizing BNPL and 49% "said they would be more likely to buy airline ancillary services" via BNPL.

## Results

* Uplift has clearly tapped into a promising travel industry fintech territory.  Due to its deep penetration into the travel industry via incorporation of its financing options on travel partners' websites, Uplift should expect increased growth as the travel industry continues to strengthen.

* Because Uplift is still privately held, little financial information is available to the public.  The core metric would be financial performance for Uplift.  Two sources estimate revenue at between $10-$28 million per year in 2021.  *Uplift Revenue*, 2021, www.zippia.com, https://www.zippia.com/uplift-careers-172919/revenue/ ($10 million); *Uplift Revenue and Competitors*, 2022, www.growjo.com, https://growjo.com/company/UpLift ($28 million).

* Another key metric is the industry's conversion rate.  Uplift touts through its press releases that it has experienced higher conversion rates among travelers; however, no hard data is provided to support this claim.

* Uplift has no real competition in its particular industry space (BNPL travel) in the manner by which it is made available to travelers.


## Recommendations

* Uplift could partner with or incorporate technology that would perform the same or similar services to Hopper.com.  Hopper provides "the ability to freeze flight and hotel prices, the power to cancel tickets for any reason, [and] price drop guarantees that automatically credit customers if rates drop—that now represent 50% of the company’s total revenue."  Sterling Kelso, Fast Company, March 8, 2022, "The 10 Most Innovative Travel Companies of 2022" https://www.fastcompany.com/90724488/most-innovative-companies-travel-2022

* If Booker is able to generate half of its revenues through the above-described services, Uplift would have a considerable advantage as it is already incorporated within traveling companies' booking websites.
